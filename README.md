## ðŸŽ¨ AI Artwork Generation (Prototype Feature)

**This is an experimental feature for testing purposes.**

### What it does
- Generates AI artwork for play programme covers using Stable Diffusion
- Creates themed artwork based on play name, synopsis, and selected theme
- Allows you to preview and optionally use generated artwork as the cover image

### How to use
1. Fill in the play name and synopsis in the form
2. Select your desired theme
3. Click the "ðŸŽ¨ Generate AI Artwork" button next to the cover image upload
4. Wait 10-30 seconds for the AI to generate artwork
5. Preview the generated image and click "Use as Cover Image" if you like it

### API Information
- Uses Hugging Face Inference API with Stable Diffusion v1.5
- Free tier demo token (may have rate limits)
- Fallback handling when service is unavailable

### Alternative APIs for Testing
If the current API becomes unavailable, you can try these free alternatives:

1. **Hugging Face Spaces**: https://huggingface.co/spaces/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5
2. **Mage.Space Demo**: https://www.mage.space/ (free tier)
3. **Replicate**: https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion (pay-per-use)

### Setup Notes
- No additional setup required for basic usage
- For production use, obtain a proper Hugging Face API token
- Replace the demo token in `server.js` line with your own token:
  ```javascript
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_HF_TOKEN_HERE'
  ```

### Removing the Feature
To disable or remove the AI artwork feature:

1. **Frontend**: Remove or comment out lines marked with "AI artwork prototype" in `views/form.ejs`
2. **Backend**: Remove or comment out the `/generate-ai-artwork` route in `server.js`
3. **Dependencies**: Remove the `https` import if not used elsewhere

All existing functionality remains completely unchanged.
